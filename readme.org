#+title: Convert GPTel Chat Buffer to a Denote file

[[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][GPTel]] is a simple Large Language Model chat client for Emacs. The ~gptel~ function starts a chat session where users can interact with the active Large Language Model (LLM).  

The ~gptel-denote~ function converts a GPTel buffer to a [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote][Denote]] file to store it for future reference.

This function generates a title and keywords using the active LLM, using the content of the buffer.

Keywords are appended with the customisable ~gptel-denote-keyword~. This keyword ensures that AI-generated content is marked as such.

When the file is saved, GPTel adds file properties to indicate some of the metadata used to generate this content, such as the used backend, mode, system prompt and bounds.

This package is not distributed through ELPA or MELPA. To install it on your system use (Emacs 29.1 or higher):

#+begin_src elisp
    (unless (package-installed-p 'gptel-denote)
    (package-vc-install
     '(gptel-denote
       :url "https://github.com/pprevos/gptel-denote/")))
#+end_src

Thanks to [[https://github.com/oantolin][Omar Antol√≠n Camarena]] for getting me started.

A minor issue with this package is that because GPTel is asynchronous, sometimes the wrong content is stored in a variable. If you have a solution than please submit a pull request.

* Future work
- [ ] Mitigate synchronicity issue
- [ ] Remove keywords not in existing Denote files
- [ ] Provide title and keywords as a user prompt so they can be corrected
